## ❓ What is nanocl ?

It's an open source [Hybrid Cloud Orchestrator](https://docs.next-hat.com/docs/guides/nanocl/overview) ! <br />
For managing `containers` and `virtual machines` on multiple hosts. <br />
It provides basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling. <br />
Helping you to create an `Hybrid Cloud` with optional `Vpn` and `Dns` controllers.

Builds upon `Rust` to have the best performance and a smallest footprint. <br />
It's use the best ideas and practices from the community. <br />
You can build an entire CI/CD pipeline from `tests` to `high availability production`. <br />
See it as a `Kubernetes` alternative with more feature and a network security layer.

This repository is the `CLI` version you can see the `Daemon` [here](https://github.com/nxthat/nanocld).
