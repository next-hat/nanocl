# Contribution guide

Joining an unknown project can be difficult, even if you have some experience.<br />
This documentation will help you to setup `Nanocl` in development.<br />
Note: `Nanocl` heavily utilizes [ntex](https://ntex.rs) as **client** and **server**

## 📁 Project Structure

`Nanocl` is using a **mono repository structure**.<br />

```sh

```

## 💾 Installation

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nxthat/nanocl
```

To build and run `Nanocl` you will need these dependencies

* [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) >= 1.67
* [docker](https://www.docker.com) >= 1.41

* gcc
* make
* libpq-dev
* openssl-dev

### 🐧 Ubuntu

If you are running ubuntu, the following scripts will install the required dependencies:

```sh
./scripts/ubuntu.deps.sh
```

If you need docker:

```sh
./scripts/install_docker.ubuntu.sh
```

### 🦀 Rust

To install rust

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Afterwards install rust devtools required to run `Nanocl`

```sh
./scripts/rust.deps.sh
```

## 🏃 Running

Make sure your are in docker group, if not then you can add yourself:

```sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

Before running `Nanocl` we will need to download and build some docker images:

```sh
./scripts/install_dev_image.sh
```

Then spin up `Nanocl` services using `docker compose` (note that you need use vpnkit profile for docker desktop [see below](#docker-desktop)):

```sh
docker compose up
```

### 🐋 Docker Desktop

With Docker Desktop you'll need an additional container, to enable it run docker compose with profile `vpnkit`

```sh
docker compose --profile vpnkit up
```

If you can have Docker installed normally with his default socket on `/var/run/docker.sock` you can also change the context:

```sh
docker context ls
docker context use default
```

In case you want to be using Docker desktop, you will not be able to reach services that aren't public.

Once started, a swagger should be available on [http://localhost:8585/explorer](http://localhost:8585/explorer).

</div>

Note that a _env variable_ could be passed to change the port, it is hardcoded for now.<br />
It could be a nice and easy first issue and pull request if you would like to help :).

To use the CLI you need correct permission on `/run/nanocl`

```sh
sudo chmod -R /run/nanocl
```

Now you can run the CLI:

- Using cargo make

  ```sh
  cargo make run-cli version
  ```

- Using cargo

  ```sh
  cargo run --bin nanocl version
  ```

## 🧪 Testing

To run tests, make sure all `Nanocl` services are running with `docker compose up`.<br/>
Then be sure to have correct permission set on `/run/nanocl`<br />
You also need theses entries in your `/etc/hosts`

```
127.0.0.1 nstore.nanocl.internal
127.0.0.1 ndaemon.nanocl.internal
```

- Run all tests

  ```sh
  cargo make tests
  ```

- Run all tests with print output

  ```sh
  cargo make tests-debug
  ```

- Run only daemon tests

  ```sh
  cargo make tests-daemon
  ```

- Run only cli tests

  ```sh
  cargo make tests-cli
  ```

- Run only client tests
  ```sh
  cargo make tests-client
  ```

On test fails make sure to remove any resource or cargo still alive after tests

## 👌 Usefull Command

Some usefull command to know:

- lsns - list namespaces

  ```sh
  lsns
  ```

- nsenter - run program in different namespaces

  ```sh
  sudo nsenter -t 12267 -n ss -ltu
  ```

- Generate a nanocld client

  ```sh
  docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/local openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate -g rust -i /local/specs/v1/swagger.json -o /local/client
  ```

- Generate ssl cert from certbot
  ```sh
  nanocl cargo -n system exec nproxy -- certbot --nginx --email email@email.com --agree-tos -d your-domain.com
  ```

## Version bumping

On version bump of api or proxy, example files have to be updated to the last version to avoid test failing
