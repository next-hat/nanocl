## ❓ What is Nanocl ?

`Nanocl` is a **distributed system** that simplifies the management of `containers` and `virtual machines` across multiple `hosts` also called `nodes`.
With `Nanocl`, you can **efficiently share resources** and **deploy applications**, **services**, and **databases** `publicly`, `privately`, or under a `VPN`.
Whether you're running a **home lab** setup or a **large enterprise**, _Nanocl's cutting-edge technology_, crafted with precision using `Rust`, provides **unparalleled performance** and a **small footprint**.

## ❓ Why Nanocl ?

`Nanocl` is all about easing your container and VM management with Rust-powered platform. 
With `Nanocl`, say goodbye to complex setups and hello to easy, efficient deployments.  
We stand for robust performance and efficiency with simplicity, trimming the bloat to keep your systems lean. 
***Join us and help shape the future of cloud computing - it's about time things got a bit more rusty***.

## 🚀 Key Benefits

- Easy deployment and management
- Significantly reduce the delay between writing code and shipping it to production
- Efficiently manage and scale your infrastructure as your needs evolve
- Enhance security by isolating services using namespaces and networks.
- Enjoy peace of mind with automatic backups, zero downtime fail-over, and comprehensive log monitoring
- Enjoy history tracking of your container and virtual machine configuration
- Revert configuration as quickly as pressing a button
- Build an entire CI/CD pipeline, from tests to high-availability production
- Best ideas and practices from the community

## 🧿 Architecture

`Nanocl` is designed in a **micro services** architecture several component are required and they are running as **container** included the `Nanocl Daemon` itself.
The following components will be installed during `nanocl setup` and are required to ensure `Nanocl` functionnality:

- `nstore` to save our state
- `ndaemon` as **REST API** to manage everything
- `nmetrics` to monitor cpu, memory and network usage
- `nproxy` proxy to redirect traffic to our **containers** and **virtual machines**
- `ncdproxy` to update proxy configuration based on the current state
- `ndns` to manage the dns entries for the **containers** and **virtual machines**
- `ncddns` to update dns entries based on the current state

## 📚 Documentation

To learn more about `Nanocl`, you can take a look at the following resources:

- [Overview](https://docs.next-hat.com/guides/nanocl)
- [Get Started](https://docs.next-hat.com/guides/nanocl/get-started)
- [CLI References](https://docs.next-hat.com/references/nanocl/cli)
- [DAEMON References](https://docs.next-hat.com/references/nanocl/daemon/overview)

## 📋 Requirements

To work properly `Nanocl` must have theses dependencies installed on the system:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) minimum version 1.41

## 💾 Installation

To install `Nanocl`, please refer to our online [installation guide](https://docs.next-hat.com/setups/nanocl).

## 🔧 Usage

`Nanocl` is designed to be easy to operate by mostly using **state files**.<br />
**State Files** are `yaml` files that define the state you want.<br />
There is an example used to deploy our [documentation](https://docs.next-hat.com):

```yaml
ApiVersion: v0.7
Kind: Deployment

Namespace: nexthat

# See all options:
# https://docs.next-hat.com/references/nanocl/cargo
Cargoes:
  - Name: doc
    Container:
      Image: nexthat-doc:0.4.1

# See all options:
# https://docs.next-hat.com/references/nanocl/resource
Resources:
  - Name: docs.next-hat.com
    Kind: ProxyRule
    Version: v0.1
    Config:
      Watch:
        - doc.nexthat
      Rules:
        - Domain: docs.next-hat.com
          Network: Public
          Ssl:
            Certificate: /etc/letsencrypt/live/docs.next-hat.com/fullchain.pem
            CertificateKey: /etc/letsencrypt/live/docs.next-hat.com/privkey.pem
            Dhparam: /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem
          Includes:
            - /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf
          Locations:
            - Path: /
              Target:
                CargoKey: doc.nexthat
                CargoPort: 80
```

To apply a state we can do it easily bu running `nanocl state apply -f path|url`<br />
We can also revert a state by calling `nanocl state revert -f path|url`
